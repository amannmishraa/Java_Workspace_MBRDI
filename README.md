# Java Daily Progress Tracker

This repository is for my **daily progress tracker for Java**. It contains practice code, examples, and exercises to track my learning journey in Java programming.


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.


## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Daily Progress Tracker

- Each Java program, exercise, or concept learned is added here.
- Helps to review what has been practiced each day.
- Encourages consistent learning and improvement in Java programming skills.
