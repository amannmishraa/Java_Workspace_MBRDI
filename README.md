# Java Daily Progress Tracker

This repository is for my **daily progress tracker for Java**. It contains practice code, examples, and exercises to track my learning journey in Java programming.

## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Daily Progress Tracker

- Each Java program, exercise, or concept learned is added here.
- Helps to review what has been practiced each day.
- Encourages consistent learning and improvement in Java programming skills.

> Tip: You can create subfolders inside `src` for different topics like `OOP`, `Arrays`, `Loops`, etc., to organize your daily practice efficiently.

### Daily Progress Table

| Date       | Topic / Concept       | Program / Exercise | Notes / Observations           |
|------------|---------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| 2026-02-06 | Arrays               | Sum of array      | Learned how to sum elements    |
| 2026-02-06 | OOP Basics           | Animal Example    | Practiced abstraction & polymorphism |
| YYYY-MM-DD | [Topic]             | [Program Name]    | [What you learned or struggled with] |

>I'll add a new row for each day or new exercise to track my progress.
